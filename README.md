# The Best FOSS Password Manager

Ever felt scared of using a password manager because of how insecure it was? Never fear - the best password manager you've ever seen is here! And better yet, it's free and open source!

The Best FOSS Password Manager is now open to the whole wide world! Now *YOU* can keep all your private credentials safe on this public platform! :rocket:

Create an account by adding a csv file and add all your *very very real passwords* to it - it's as simple as that! Putting all your important credentials on GitHub for safekeeping has never been easier.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new csv file, or copy `TEMPLATE_PASSWORDS.csv` and rename it to `[YOUR NAME OR GITHUB USERNAME]_PASSWORDS.csv`.
3. Add all your credentials, safe and secure. Make sure they are *absolutely real!*
4. Open a PR and get it merged.
5. Congratulations! All your passwords are now ULTRA SECURE!

## Security Principles we follow:

- **Principle of least privilege**: we make users pinky promise not to peek at anyone else's credentials.
- **Separation of duties**: we force collusion by having users fork the repository and make a PR that must be signed off by at least one other person.
- **Secure by design**: it's such a stylish password manager.
- **Keep it simple**: does this need explanation?
- **Defense in depth**: ...we'll get back to you on that one

Best of all, it's the antithesis of the **Security by Obscurity** anti-pattern: rest assured, *nothing* will be obscured in *this* password manager!
